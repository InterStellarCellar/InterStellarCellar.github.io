# My Portfolio

Welcome to the source code for my personal portfolio website. It's a simple and straight-to-the-point site that showcases my work, links, and maybe a few surprises. No fluff, just the essentials.

## Features

- **About Me**: A short intro because who reads long bios anyway?
- **Projects**: A showcase of what Iâ€™ve worked on.
- **Links**: Quick access to my socials, GitHub, and other online stuff.

## How to Run It

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/portfolio.git
2. Navigate to the project directory: 
   ```bash
   cd portfolio
3. Open index.html in your favorite browser.

## Customization

Feel free to fork this repo and tweak it to fit your needs. Replace my links with yours, change the colors, or even rewrite this README if you want.

## Contributing

Nope. This is my personal site, but thanks for the thought. ðŸ˜„

## License

No license. Just donâ€™t steal my identity, okay?
